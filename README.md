# Secret Family Recipes Website

# User Interface

This was part of a project that included working with a React team and a backend team.

The project included setting up a site that would store your secret family recipes.

The user interface part has a home page that is also a marketing page, an about page that gives everyone a look at who worked on the site as a whole and a login/sign up link to direct people to where to go to look at their personal account.
